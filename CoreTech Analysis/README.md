## Project Overview
This project was carried out with a team of data scientist from 10Alytics in collaboration with CoreTech Labs
to dig into the data set provided; carrying out a Comprehensive Analysis of Road Traffic Accident.

CoreTech labs is a technology solutions business, specializing in software development, AI integration, 
and data-driven innovations. As a team working, we were presented with this problem: "Road accidents remains a 
critical public safety concern, with multiple factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions,
speed limits, and traffic controls influencing accident severity. However, raw accident data often exists in 
unstructured formats, making It difficult for stakeholders at CoreTech to derive actionable insights.

Hence, as a team of data scientist from 10Alytics, we were tasked to perform statistical analysis and 
Create dashboards for better understanding of the data

## Project Objective
-To Clean and Standardize the Accident Dataset
- To Analyze the Frequency and Severity of Accidents
- To Identify High-Risk Factors Contributing to Accidents
- To Perform Descriptive Statistical Analysis
- To Develop an Interactive Excel Dashboard for Data Visualization
- To Provide Data-Driven Recommendations for Road Safety Improvements


## Data Source
The data set used was provided by CoreTech Labs.  

## Key Insights
Our analysis showed a decline in accident cases from 2021 to 2022, as shown in our trend line 
hence indicating improved road safety or effective interventions. However, most accidents were frequent 
during the evening hours (particularly between 4â€“8 PM) and in the morning 6-12.

This pattern can be attributed to increased traffic during rush hour, driver fatigue after a full workday, 
reduced visibility as daylight fades. Fridays is the dangerous day due to the records of numerous accidents
often involve more travel, social outings, and end-of-week stress, all of which contribute to elevated accident risk..

## Conclusion
Using standardized data sets in developing dashboards is crucial to uncovering key trends and insights in 
data across all industries.
